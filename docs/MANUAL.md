# OMERO.Analysis Manual

OMERO.Analysis combines browser-local data analysis, reusable Methods and
Pipelines, run-only Notebooks, and automatic synchronization with OMERO.
Notebook code and generated Python run locally in the browser. Source data are
not sent to the configured AI provider.

## Getting started

1. Select an Image, Dataset, Plate, or Screen in OMERO.web. Multiple Images or
   multiple Plates may be selected together to create one selection-specific
   Workspace.
2. Choose **Analysis** in the center-panel menu.
3. Select the data attachments needed for the analysis.
4. Open Analysis. Inputs appear in the Workspace **Input** folder.

While Analysis restores OMERO data, settings, reusable artifacts, and input
bindings, a **Preparing Workspace** progress indicator reports each stage.
Explorer is rooted directly at the Workspace launched by the OMERO center
panel; it does not browse parent OMERO objects or alternate local Workspaces.

The OMERO.web middle pane adapts to the selected object:

- ordinary Datasets, Screens, Plates, and Images offer a new or existing
  source Workspace;
- multiple Images or Plates create one Workspace while remaining distinct from
  each individually opened object;
- a managed Dataset under `+AnalysisWorkspaces` offers to resume its source
  Workspace and summarizes its revision and reusable contents;
- a synchronized result Image links back to its source Workspace;
- the `+AnalysisWorkspaces` Project explains and displays the managed library;
- `~AnalysisSettings`, **AI Settings**, and **Skills** show information only;
- Projects, Wells, mixed selections, and unsupported objects explain which
  Dataset, Screen, Plate, or Image selection to use.

Analysis opens on **Home**. Choose **Run a Method**, **Run a Pipeline**,
**Run a Notebook**, **Create a Method**, **Create a Pipeline**, or **Create a
Notebook**.

## Workspace structure

- **Input** contains OMERO attachments and browser-local files used by analyses.
- **Methods** contains reusable Python analyses and Method results. Its nested
  **Assistant** folder contains Method-development conversations, attachments,
  and browser-local validation results.
- **Pipelines** contains ordered Method executions and Pipeline results.
- **Notebooks** contains attached, uploaded, or converted notebooks and Notebook
  results.

The Artifact Inspector can inspect every selectable Workspace item. The left
Explorer and right Artifact Inspector are resizable and can each be hidden or
restored with the buttons in the application header. This visibility choice is
remembered for the current user and group in the browser.

## Home and Method-authoring Assistant

Home is the default landing page and keeps reusable analyses prominent. The
Assistant inspects supported data locally and may test Python in the isolated
browser runtime, but its final deliverable must be a complete reusable Python
Method script. The final Assistant card starts with a concise **Summary**, **Review**,
and **Recommendations**; its complete script is kept in a collapsed **Show reusable
Method code** section. If a model returns only prose, plots, files, or source code
without the review, Analysis asks it for the complete structured response. Saved Methods and Pipelines are run from Home, Explorer,
the Artifact Inspector, or the **Methods** and **Pipelines** tabs, not from the Assistant.
The Home **Create a Method** card offers **With Assistant** and, while the
artifact editor is enabled, **New Method**. New Methods include explicit paths
for all ready Workspace inputs. Editing existing artifacts is available in the
corresponding **Methods**, **Pipelines**, or **Notebooks** tab and in Explorer
and Artifact Inspector actions, keeping Home focused on running and creating.

For offline and fallback model choices by CPU, GPU memory, context budget, and
LM Studio profile, see [Local LLM Recommendations](local-llm-recommendations.md).

Use **Attach files** or **File URL** beside the composer to add up to ten
Assistant-wide attachments of at most 25 MiB each. Supported formats are UTF-8 TXT,
searchable PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPEG, and WebP. Direct URLs must be public HTTPS
file URLs that the browser can fetch without credentials; webpages are not
supported. PDF and DOCX extraction runs in browser Python, and OCR is not
performed. A missing, unreadable, oversized, or image-only document blocks
sending until it is reselected or removed.

Attachment text must fit the displayed model-context budget and is never
silently truncated. Images require a vision-capable model; Analysis uses local
server metadata when available and performs one harmless cached image probe
when support is unknown. Changing to a non-vision model keeps the originals
but blocks sending while image attachments remain active.

Every user message is followed by a collapsed **AI activity** card. The final
Assistant response appears next, followed by any **Analysis (local)** results.
Local plots remain hidden until the Assistant turn has finished. Expand the
activity card to see the live response, concise
progress and validation steps, tool purposes, and the completed user-facing AI
transcript for that turn. Private model chain-of-thought is neither displayed
nor stored.

When the assistant cannot continue without a real choice, the activity card
opens automatically and presents two to four answer buttons. Selecting an
answer resumes the same AI turn. **Stop** cancels a waiting question as well as
the running analysis. A question restored after reloading the page is shown as
inactive; answer it as a new Assistant message.

Each assistant response has two small controls:

- The **copy icon** immediately before the star copies the complete assistant
  response, including its Markdown, to the clipboard.
- The **star** pins or unpins the message. An empty star means the message is
  not pinned; a filled star means it is pinned. Pinned messages are retained
  in the context sent to the AI even when an older, long conversation is
  compacted. Use this for important decisions, definitions, caveats, or
  results that later questions still need. Pinning does not save a Method,
  attach anything to OMERO, or prevent the Assistant conversation itself from being deleted.

Recent messages are included automatically, so it is not necessary to pin
every response. Pin only information that should remain available throughout
a long Assistant conversation. Click the filled star again to unpin it.

Saving is available only after the assistant has finished the turn. A saved
Method contains the final assistant summary as Python comments above the
reproducible code.

When an answer is supported by generated files, **Supporting results** buttons
name the actual image or data file they open in the Artifact Inspector.
Repeated executions that produced identical bytes are shown only once; an
image and its corresponding CSV remain separate because they are different
forms of evidence.

## Methods and Pipelines

A Method is reusable Python with version history and an inferred input
contract. Select at least two Methods and use **To Pipeline** to create an
ordered Pipeline. Use **To Notebook** to convert selected Methods or Pipelines
that do not depend on ZarrViewer.

The Method menu provides **Run**, **Rename**, **Download**, and **Delete
method**. The Pipeline menu provides the corresponding **Run**, **Rename**,
**Download**, and **Delete pipeline** actions.

When **Enable artifact editor** is on, Method and Pipeline menus and their
Artifact Inspector views also provide **Edit**. The Editor strictly resolves
every referenced `/input/...` file before opening. Exact filenames are used
first; otherwise exactly one ready file with the same extension is required.
Missing or ambiguous input data stops the editor from opening and is reported
as an error. Pipelines may bind later steps to literal `/output/...` files
declared by earlier steps.

The Methods folder also shows **New** while the editor is enabled. It creates
`untitled01.py`, or the first higher unused two-digit name, and opens it in the
Editor. It uses the same input-ready template as Home. Python uses semantic
syntax colors, and SQL in a triple-quoted `sql`,
`query`, or `statement` assignment is highlighted as SQL.

Home **Create a Pipeline** opens the Pipeline builder in **Pipelines**. Select
Methods in execution order and create the Pipeline with the same shared flow as
**To Pipeline** in Explorer.

Running a Method opens **Methods** and running a Pipeline opens **Pipelines**.
Both tabs have independent, type-specific run histories. Each direct run has
durable status, resolved bindings, execution details, and generated files. A
Pipeline additionally shows the status of every ordered step. On the first run
after opening Analysis, a progress bar reports browser-Python startup and
package-loading progress. Direct runs do
not add synthetic prompts or results to the Assistant, and deleting an Assistant conversation does not
delete their run history or outputs.

## Notebooks

Notebooks are Python nbformat-4 documents. Outside the optional artifact
Editor they are read-only and never run automatically. Use **Open** to inspect
a Notebook and **Run** to reset the kernel, attach current inputs, and execute
all cells in order.

The Notebook menu provides **Open**, **Run**, **Rename**, **Download**, and
**Delete notebook**. Deleting the browser copy does not delete an existing
OMERO FileAnnotation.

With the artifact editor enabled, **Edit** opens a structured cell editor after
strictly reattaching current inputs. The generated input-binding cell is
read-only. Saving edited content clears stored execution counts and outputs so
stale results are not presented as current. Code cells use Python and embedded
SQL syntax highlighting. Markdown cells render formatted text when run or
previewed. Raw text cells preserve text exactly and are neither executed nor
formatted. The Notebooks folder **New** button creates the first available
`untitled01.ipynb`-style name and opens it in the Editor. Home **Create a
Notebook** uses the same creation path, or converts a selected Pipeline. A new
Notebook already contains the read-only OMERO.Analysis input-binding cell, an
editable code cell, and references to all ready Workspace inputs.

Use **Reattach input data** after the Workspace inputs change. Analysis
synchronizes the ready local inputs under `/input`, adds or updates one visible
first code cell named **OMERO.Analysis input bindings**, and updates
unambiguous `/input/...` filenames in the remaining code cells. Reattaching
the same inputs updates that binding cell instead of creating duplicates.

Notebook execution does not load AI providers, Assistant skills, JupyterLab,
widgets, shell commands, or network package downloads.

## Workspace synchronization

Analysis automatically mirrors reusable Workspace content into the marked
`+AnalysisWorkspaces` Project for the current user and group. It sends only
changed items and does not create or upload a large Workspace ZIP. PNG results
from direct Method, Pipeline, and Notebook runs become OMERO Images. Other
direct results, Methods, Pipelines, and Notebooks become typed attachments.

Ready input files with `template` anywhere in the filename are also
synchronized under `Templates`. Other source inputs are excluded.
Assistant conversations, attachments, and validation results are always
excluded. They remain browser-local; extracted text and source URLs are never
synchronized.

Synchronization is automatic and incremental. Creating, editing, deleting, or
running a reusable artifact schedules an incremental save. Deleting a managed
Workspace Dataset in OMERO is also authoritative: on the next launch, browser
focus, or periodic check, Analysis removes that Workspace and all of its local
Methods, Pipelines, Notebooks, Assistant chats, runs, and files. A new
browser-local Workspace that has never synchronized is never removed, and a
failed OMERO status request is not treated as deletion. A failed save shows a
retry action in the Explorer. Automatic saves do not create or upload a full
Workspace ZIP.

Identical result bytes are stored only once in the synchronized Dataset, even
when the same PNG or CSV belongs to multiple direct Method, Pipeline, or
Notebook runs. A managed Key-Value Pair records every originating Workspace item,
so deduplication does not discard provenance.

## Reusing AnalysisWorkspaces

Use **Reuse from +AnalysisWorkspaces** to browse synchronized Datasets and copy
Methods, Pipelines, or Notebooks into the current browser Workspace. Imports
are independent copies and do not modify the library original.

The single Analysis OMERO panel can import Methods, Pipelines, and Notebooks.

## Analysis Settings

**Enable artifact editor** is off by default. Enabling it adds the **Editor**
tab beside the standard Analysis tabs and adds **Edit** to Method, Pipeline, and Notebook
menus and Artifact Inspector views. Methods save as a new version, Pipelines
increment their version, and Notebooks update in place. **Save and Run** always
saves before delegating to the existing runner. Use Ctrl+S or Cmd+S to save;
leaving a dirty editor asks before discarding changes. The preference applies
to the current user and group and is saved automatically.

**Plot + CSV** asks the Assistant-authored Method to save both a visual plot
and the corresponding tabular data. This preference is saved automatically.

Analysis Settings, AI profiles, and user-added skills are saved automatically
to the encrypted `~AnalysisSettings` bundle for the current user and group.
There are no synchronization switches or manual Settings sync button.

Use the sun/moon button immediately before **Settings** to switch between the
default dark interface and the BIOMERO-inspired light interface. The selected
theme is remembered in the browser and saved automatically.

## AI profiles

An AI profile contains:

- A profile name
- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages protocol
- Provider endpoint
- Authentication-header type
- Model or deployment name
- API key
- Optional context-window size

Use **Validate connection** after editing a profile. The validation request is
small but may be billed by the provider. When validation succeeds in an OMERO
context that supports Settings synchronization, Analysis synchronizes the
updated profiles and other Settings automatically.

The **Local AI server** panel is collapsed by default. Expand it to detect LM
Studio or Ollama, enter another local OpenAI-compatible URL, select a detected
model, or create a local AI profile.

All profiles are saved automatically in the marked `~AnalysisSettings` Project
and its **AI Settings** Dataset. The settings JSON is placed in an encrypted
server-side bundle before it is attached to OMERO. Encryption is scoped to the
current OMERO user and group.

## Skills

A skill is Markdown guidance that helps the Assistant understand a data format or
domain. It does not execute code and is never loaded by Notebook.

Automatically discovered BIOMERO and ZarrViewer skills are shown as collapsed
cards. Their source links open the provider repository or skill URL.

You can upload a Markdown skill or link a direct HTTPS Markdown URL. User
skills can be enabled or disabled. Enabled skills match all inputs unless
their metadata lists file extensions.

## Simple skill format

A simple skill can be one Markdown file:

```markdown
---
name: my-table-guide
description: Explains the exported measurement tables
extensions: csv, xlsx
---

# Tables

`objects.csv` contains one row per segmented object.
`images.csv` contains image metadata.

# Relationships

Join `objects.image_id` to `images.id`.

# Analysis guidance

Use `well` as the experimental unit and do not treat individual objects as
independent replicates.
```

Useful skill content includes table meanings, primary keys, relationships,
units, missing-value conventions, experimental units, and analysis caveats.
Do not put API keys or other secrets in skill files.

Uploaded skills are copied into the **Skills** Dataset in
`~AnalysisSettings` automatically.

## Settings synchronization

Analysis automatically synchronizes:

- Analysis Settings
- Every AI profile
- User-added skills

Settings are scoped to the current OMERO user and group. Opening Analysis in
the same group restores the latest synchronized settings when available.

## Privacy and security

- Data analysis and Notebook execution run in the browser.
- Ordinary Workspace input files remain browser-local. AI requests contain
  prompts, generated code, bounded previews and summaries, errors, and—for
  selected Assistant attachments only—extracted text or metadata-stripped image
  pixels. Original PDF and DOCX bytes are never sent to the provider.
- API keys synchronized to OMERO are encrypted at rest.
- Custom skills are instructions and can influence Assistant behavior. Add skills
  only from sources you trust.
- Notebook HTML and JavaScript output are not executed.

## Troubleshooting

Browser Python starts lazily when the Assistant, a Method, a Pipeline, a Notebook, or a
database inspection first needs it. Merely opening Analysis, Settings, or a
Notebook does not copy inputs into Python.

If the Assistant is unavailable, check that the Workspace inputs are ready and that the
active AI profile has an endpoint, model, and any required key. Use **Validate
connection** for specific endpoint, authentication, model, CORS, or
response-format errors.

If synchronization fails, confirm that the selected OMERO group permits
Project/Dataset creation and FileAnnotation creation, then retry after the
session keepalive has renewed the connection. Unexpected server failures show
a short request ID; include it when checking server logs or reporting the
problem.

If a custom URL skill cannot be loaded, use a direct HTTPS Markdown URL or
upload the file. GitHub `blob` URLs are converted to their raw-content form.
